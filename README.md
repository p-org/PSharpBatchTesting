Batch Testing for P#
====================
This project extends the [P#](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp) asynchronous programming framework with cloud testing capabilities. It uses the [Azure Batch Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/batch/) APIs to run multiple parallel P# tests on Azure and fetch the results.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to read our [wiki](https://github.com/p-org/PSharpBatchTesting/wiki).

To run PSharpBatchTester, you must have an active [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) subscription containing a Batch Service account.
